# RustCodes

In this repository, I will be learning Rust programming language and writing various code examples to understand its basic functionalities and data types. Rust is a modern systems programming language known for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency features. Through these code examples, I aim to explore Rust's syntax, concepts, and best practices.

## Objective

To gain a solid understanding of Rust programming language.
To explore and experiment with Rust's features, such as ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and concurrency.
To build proficiency in writing efficient and safe Rust code.
Contents
The repository will include code examples covering various aspects of Rust programming, including but not limited to:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Functions and control flow
- Ownership and borrowing
- Structs, enums, and traits
- Error handling
- Concurrency and parallelism
- File I/O and networking
- Testing and documentation

## Structure

The repository will be organized into different directories, each focusing on specific topics or concepts. Within each directory, there will be individual Rust source code files containing code examples related to that topic. Additionally, there will be README files providing explanations, insights, and instructions for running the code examples.

## Technologies Used

Rust Programming Language
Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system)
Contribution
